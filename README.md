ModelCollab is a web-based collaborative modelling application with the front end in Typescript, React, and Firebase, and the modelling logic in Julia.

ModelCollab is written by Eric Redekopp, Xiaoyan Li, and Long Pham of the University of Saskatchewan CEPHIL lab, with support from Dr. Nathaniel Osgood.

The current production version of this application is available for public use. See the instructions in the docs for more information.

Design
Modelcollab currently consists of 3 components:

The React frontend, found in the 'webui' directory
The server which invokes the Julia code, found in the 'server' directory
The Firebase database, which runs on the Firebase servers. The "Database" directory still exists for posterity but doesn't include anything particularly interesting anymore.
No build instructions for a local development build are included at this time. If you would like detailed build instructions to run the software locally, please create an issue requesting them.
